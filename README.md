### Setup ###

First you'll need to copy the `gradle.properties.sample` into your `gradle.properties` and fill out the jOOQ properties according to your database.


After that run `gradle wrapper` once from your command line (you have to have initialised an instance of gradle before):
```
$ gradle wrapper
```


Finally, to run the application enter `./gradlew quarkusDev` into your command line:  
```
$ ./gradlew qurakusDev
```

After that you're ready to go. :+1:
